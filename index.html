<img src="nut.jpg"alt="sulphur deficiency symptom">

<p1><br><li><b>Yellowing of leaves:</b><br>
A classic sign of sulfur deficiency, leaves may turn yellow, starting at the tips and edges and progressing inward. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn yellow.<br></li>

<b><li>Stunted growth:</b><br>
Sulfur is essential for cell division and plant development, so a lack of it can result in stunted growth. <br></li>

<b><li>Delayed maturity</b><br>
Plants with sulfur deficiency may take longer to mature and produce fruits or seeds.<br></li>

<b><li>Reduced nutrient uptake</b><br>
Sulfur deficiency can make it harder for plants to absorb other essential nutrients, like nitrogen.<br></li>
 
<b><li>Light green color</b><br>
The entire plant may appear light green, with young leaves tending to be lighter than older leaves.<br> </li>
 
<b><li>Thin stems</b><br>
Plants may have thin stems and a spindle appearance.
 Sulfur is critical for the development of healthy,nutritious crops.<br></p1></li>



<h4>MANAGEMENT MEASURES</h4>
<p2>Sulfur deficiency in groundnuts can be managed by using fertilizers, organic matter, and crop rotation:<br>
<li><b>Fertilizers</b><br>
There are many sulfur-containing fertilizers available commercially, including gradual-release, controlled-release, and water-soluble fertilizers. Some recommend applying sulfur at 70–90 kg per hectare.<br></li>
<li><b>Organic matter</b><br>
Incorporating organic matter like compost or manure into the soil can gradually increase sulfur levels over time.<br></li>
<li><b>Crop rotation</b><br>
Different crops have different sulfur requirements and uptake rates, so rotating crops can help prevent sulfur depletion in the soil.<br></li>
<li><b>Soil pH</b><br>
Maintaining optimal soil pH levels (typically around neutral to slightly acidic) is essential for ensuring adequate sulfur availability for plant uptake</br></li>
